## Experiment 2 - Poll App

Note: I had a lot of compulsory assignments in other subjects this week. So i wasn't able to spend the time that i wanted on this assignment. Thus there are some holes. 

I also had some issues setting up the JDK on intellij which i could not ressolve.

Tasks:
- 1 : Bruno
- 2 : Already done
- 3 : I creates a series of requests in bruno which i used to assess my handlers
- 4 : 
I created my handlers and accepted GET & POST reqests for creating polls & votes among other things.
I created a type called PollRequest for bundling the input data when creating the polls. Though i didn't imideately think off doing with the user as a URL parameter. Which would've been a better idea.

- 5: I wrote some short test scripts in bruno to assess my code which mostly seemed to work.
